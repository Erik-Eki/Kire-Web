# KIRE WEB

Hosting my website which hosts my blog and webcomics. It has authentication, user profiles and fully functioning comments section with rating. Svelte and Supabase do the heavy lifting here.

I mainly created to practice and try out the hot &amp; popular framework.

Ultimate goal is to make host my webcomic with the superior controls and features that allow me to and dynamic things to the comics.
