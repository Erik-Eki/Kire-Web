<a href="https://preactjs.com" style="color: mediumorchid;">Preact</a> is basically React, but with only a 3kB bundle size. It makes it much faster than normal React, as all that bloat is cut out, yet still retaining that React ~~bullshit~~ familiarity. Compatible with React ecosystem which is huge.
