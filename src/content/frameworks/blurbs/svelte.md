<a href="https://svelte.dev" style="color: orangered;">Svelte</a> was voted for the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-admired-and-desired-web-frameworks-and-technologies" style="color: orangered;">most admired JS web framework</a> in a Stackoverflow survey. It is lightweight, performant and straightforward to use, unlike React in many ways. The bundle size is also small.

This website mainly uses Svelte components as it's the most intuitive feeling framework I've tried.
